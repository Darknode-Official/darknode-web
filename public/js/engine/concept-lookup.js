// Concept lookup — the runtime consumer of the frozen WordNet-derived index.
//
// commandSynonym() in lexicon.js resolves loose verbs by traversing the live
// 11.8MB word list, which only works once that list has loaded (browser only).
// This map is the offline, always-available counterpart: it ships as a small
// object (see tools/build-concept-index.mjs), so the CLI, Node and the test
// harness understand "tally these" or "knock 3 off" without the lexicon, and
// the engine falls back to it the instant live traversal is unavailable or
// comes up empty. Pure, synchronous, no I/O.
