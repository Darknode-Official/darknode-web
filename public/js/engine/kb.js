const EXPLAIN = [
  [/\bsky\b.*\bblue\b|\bblue sky\b/, "Why the sky is blue", "Sunlight contains all colours. Air molecules scatter short (blue) wavelengths much more strongly than long (red) ones: Rayleigh scattering grows as 1/wavelength^4. That scattered blue light reaches your eyes from every direction of the sky. It is not violet because sunlight has less violet, some is absorbed high in the atmosphere, and our eyes are less sensitive to it."],
  [/\bsunsets?\b.*\b(?:red|orange|pink)\b|\b(?:red|orange) sunsets?\b|\bsky (?:red|orange) at (?:sunset|sunrise)\b/, "Why sunsets are red", "At sunrise and sunset, sunlight crosses far more air to reach you. Most of the blue is scattered out of the beam along the way, so the light that arrives directly is mostly orange and red. Dust and smoke can make the colours stronger."],
  [/\b(?:ocean|sea|oceans|seas)\b.*\bsalty\b|\bsalt\b.*\b(?:ocean|sea)\b/, "Why the ocean is salty", "Rain is slightly acidic and slowly dissolves minerals from rocks. Rivers carry those dissolved salts (mostly sodium and chloride ions) into the sea. When seawater evaporates, the water leaves but the salt stays, so over millions of years the salt built up. Undersea vents add more. Seawater is about 3.5% salt."],
  [/\bwhy do (?:we|people|humans) dream\b|\bwhy (?:do|does) (?:we |people )?(?:have )?dreams?\b|\bwhat (?:causes|are) dreams\b/, "Why we dream", "Scientists do not fully agree. Most vivid dreams happen in REM sleep, when the brain is very active. Leading ideas are that dreaming helps consolidate memories, process emotions, and rehearse responses to threats. Another idea is that dreams are the brain making sense of random activity. It is likely a mix of these."],
  [/\b(?:airplanes?|aeroplanes?|planes?|aircraft|jets?)\b.*\b(?:fly|stay up|stay in the air)\b/, "How airplanes fly", "Four forces act on a plane: lift, weight, thrust and drag. Engines provide thrust, which pushes the plane forward against drag. As air flows over the wings, their shape and angle turn the airflow downward. By Newton's third law, the air pushes the wing up, and the pressure above the wing drops (Bernoulli). That upward force is lift. When lift equals the plane's weight, it holds its height."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) the internet work\b|\bhow is the internet\b/, "How the internet works", "The internet is a network of networks. Your data is split into small packets, each labelled with source and destination IP addresses. Routers pass packets hop by hop toward their destination, across cables, fibre and wireless links run by many providers. TCP puts the packets back in order and resends lost ones. DNS turns names like example.com into IP addresses. Protocols like HTTPS run on top to deliver web pages, securely."],
  [/\bhow (?:do|does) (?:a )?vaccines? work\b/, "How vaccines work", "A vaccine shows the immune system a harmless version or piece of a germ. That can be an inactivated or weakened germ, a protein, or mRNA instructions to make one protein. The immune system makes antibodies and memory cells against it. If the real germ arrives later, those memory cells recognise it and respond fast, often before you get seriously ill."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|why do we have|how do) earthquakes?\b|\bwhy do earthquakes happen\b|\bearthquakes?\b.*\b(?:caused|happen|occur)\b/, "What causes earthquakes", "Earth's crust is broken into tectonic plates that move a few centimetres a year. Where plates meet, friction locks them together while stress builds up. When the rock suddenly slips along a fault, the stored energy is released as seismic waves: an earthquake. Most happen at plate boundaries, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|how does|why does it|how do you get|where does|what makes) rain\b|\bhow is rain (?:formed|made)\b/, "What causes rain", "The Sun heats water, which evaporates into water vapour. As warm air rises it cools, and the vapour condenses onto tiny dust particles as cloud droplets or ice crystals. Droplets collide and merge, or ice crystals grow and melt as they fall. When they get too heavy for the rising air to hold, they fall as rain. This is part of the water cycle."],
  [/\brainbows?\b.*\b(?:form|made|happen|caused|work)\b|\b(?:what causes|how do you get|how are) rainbows?\b|^what is a rainbow$/, "How rainbows form", "Sunlight enters raindrops, bends (refracts), reflects off the back of the drop, and bends again on the way out. Each colour bends by a slightly different amount, so white light spreads into a spectrum. You see a rainbow when the Sun is behind you and rain is in front. The bow sits about 42 degrees from the point directly opposite the Sun."],
  [/\bmagnets?\b.*\bwork\b|\bhow (?:does|do) magnetism work\b|\bwhat makes (?:a )?magnets?\b/, "How magnets work", "Magnetism comes from moving electric charge, including the spin of electrons. In most materials electron spins point randomly and cancel out. In iron, nickel and cobalt they line up in regions called domains. When most domains point the same way, the material becomes a magnet with north and south poles. Opposite poles attract, and like poles repel."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|why do we have|why are there|how do) (?:the )?seasons\b|\bseasons\b.*\b(?:caused|happen)\b/, "What causes the seasons", "Earth's axis is tilted about 23.4 degrees. As Earth orbits the Sun, each hemisphere takes turns leaning toward it. The hemisphere tilted toward the Sun gets more direct sunlight and longer days, so it has summer. The hemisphere tilted away has winter. The seasons are not caused by Earth's distance from the Sun: Earth is actually closest to the Sun in early January."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|how do|why are there|why do we have) (?:the )?tides?\b|\btides?\b.*\b(?:caused|work)\b/, "What causes tides", "The Moon's gravity pulls hardest on the side of Earth facing it and weakest on the far side. That difference stretches the oceans into two bulges, one toward the Moon and one opposite. As Earth rotates through the bulges, most coasts get two high and two low tides a day. The Sun adds a smaller effect. When the Sun and Moon line up, at new and full moon, you get extra-large spring tides."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|how does|why does|how do|what is) (?:lightning|thunder)\b|\bthunder\b.*\blightning\b|\blightning\b.*\bthunder\b/, "Lightning and thunder", "Inside storm clouds, colliding ice and water particles separate electric charge: the top of the cloud becomes positive and the bottom negative. When the voltage grows large enough, a giant spark jumps within the cloud or to the ground. That spark is lightning. It heats the air to about 30,000 degrees C in a fraction of a second, and the air expands explosively, which you hear as thunder. Light is faster than sound, so you see the flash first. Count the seconds between flash and thunder and divide by 3 for the distance in km (by 5 for miles)."],
  [/\bleaves\b.*\b(?:change colou?r|turn (?:red|yellow|orange|brown)|fall)\b/, "Why leaves change colour", "Leaves are green because of chlorophyll, which captures sunlight. In autumn, shorter days and cooler nights make trees stop producing chlorophyll. As it breaks down, yellow and orange pigments (carotenoids) that were there all along show through. Some trees also make red pigments (anthocyanins). Then the tree seals off the leaf stem, and the leaf falls."],
  [/\bwhy do (?:we|people|humans) (?:need to )?sleep\b|\bwhy is sleep important\b/, "Why we sleep", "Sleep lets the brain and body recover. During sleep the brain consolidates memories and learning, and clears waste products. It also resets emotional balance. The body repairs tissue, releases growth hormone and supports the immune system. Long-term lack of sleep harms attention, mood, metabolism and health. Most adults need 7 or more hours a night."],
  [/\bwhy do (?:we|people) yawn\b|\bwhy (?:is|are) yawn(?:ing|s) contagious\b/, "Why we yawn", "The exact reason is still debated. A leading idea is that yawning helps cool the brain, by drawing in air and increasing blood flow. It often comes when we are tired or bored, or when our state is changing, such as waking up. It is contagious, probably linked to social bonding and empathy, and is more contagious between people who are close."],
  [/\bice\b.*\bfloat\b/, "Why ice floats", "Water is unusual: it is densest as a liquid at about 4 degrees C. When it freezes, hydrogen bonds lock the molecules into an open hexagonal lattice, which takes up about 9% more space. Ice is therefore less dense than liquid water, so it floats. That is why lakes freeze from the top down, which protects the life below."],
  [/\b(?:grass|plants?|leaves)\b.*\bgreen\b/, "Why plants are green", "Plants contain chlorophyll, which absorbs mostly red and blue light to power photosynthesis. It reflects green light, so green is the colour we see."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:the |a |your )?(?:human )?heart work\b|\bhow does blood (?:flow|circulate)\b/, "How the heart works", "The heart is a muscular pump with four chambers. The right side receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the body. Valves keep the blood flowing one way. An electrical signal from the sinoatrial node sets each beat, about 60 to 100 times a minute at rest."],
  [/\bcats?\b.*\bpurr\b/, "Why cats purr", "Cats purr by rapidly twitching the muscles of the larynx as they breathe in and out, about 25 to 150 times a second. They purr when content, but also when stressed, injured or giving birth. So it seems to be both communication and self-soothing. Some research suggests the vibration frequencies may even help healing."],
  [/\bhow do birds fly\b|\bhow can birds fly\b/, "How birds fly", "Birds' wings are shaped like aerofoils. Moving air over them creates lift, just like an airplane wing. Flapping pushes air down and back, giving both lift and thrust. Birds are also built for flight: hollow but strong bones, powerful breast muscles, feathers that make a light, smooth wing surface, and a very efficient one-way airflow through their lungs."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) electricity work\b|\bwhat is electricity\b/, "How electricity works", "Electricity is the flow of electric charge, usually electrons moving through a conductor such as copper. A voltage (like a battery or generator) pushes the charge around a closed circuit. Current is how much charge flows per second, and resistance opposes the flow; Ohm's law ties them together as V = I x R. Electrical energy can be turned into light, heat, motion and more."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?computers? work\b/, "How computers work", "A computer stores everything as binary: 0s and 1s in memory. The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them and executes them, billions of times a second. It does arithmetic, compares values and moves data around. Its circuits are built from billions of tiny transistor switches. Input devices feed it data, storage keeps it, and the operating system coordinates programs and hardware."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:wi-?fi|wireless internet) work\b/, "How Wi-Fi works", "A Wi-Fi router sends and receives data as radio waves, usually at 2.4, 5 or 6 GHz. Your device's wireless chip encodes data onto those waves and decodes the waves it receives. The router connects to your internet line and passes packets between your devices and the internet. WPA2 or WPA3 encryption protects the traffic from eavesdroppers."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?gps work\b/, "How GPS works", "About 30 GPS satellites orbit Earth, each broadcasting its position and a precise time from an atomic clock. Your receiver measures how long each signal took to arrive, which gives its distance from that satellite. With four or more satellites it can solve for its position and the clock error: this is trilateration. The satellites' clocks even need corrections for relativity."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?batter(?:y|ies) work\b/, "How batteries work", "A battery has two electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by an electrolyte. Chemical reactions at the anode release electrons. The electrons can only reach the cathode through the outside circuit, so they flow through your device as an electric current. Ions move through the electrolyte inside to balance the charge. In a rechargeable battery, such as lithium-ion, charging drives the reactions in reverse."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?(?:fridge|refrigerator)s? work\b/, "How refrigerators work", "A refrigerant fluid is pumped around a loop. Inside the fridge it evaporates, and evaporating absorbs heat, cooling the interior. A compressor then squeezes the vapour, which makes it hot. It releases that heat through the coils at the back and condenses back into a liquid. Then it passes through an expansion valve and the cycle repeats. The fridge moves heat out; it does not make cold."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|what makes|where does) (?:the )?wind\b|\bhow is wind (?:formed|made)\b/, "What causes wind", "The Sun heats Earth unevenly: land warms faster than sea, and the equator more than the poles. Warm air rises and lowers the pressure below it. Cooler, higher-pressure air flows in to replace it, and that moving air is wind. Earth's rotation deflects large-scale winds (the Coriolis effect), which shapes global wind belts."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|how do|why do) volcano(?:e)?s?\b|\bvolcano(?:e)?s?\b.*\b(?:erupt|form)\b/, "How volcanoes work", "Deep underground, rock melts into magma, mostly where tectonic plates pull apart, where one plate sinks under another, or over hot spots. Magma is lighter than the rock around it, so it rises and collects in chambers. Gas dissolved in it builds pressure, like a shaken bottle. When the pressure beats the rock above, magma erupts as lava, ash and gas."],
  [/\b(?:northern|southern) lights\b|\baurora(?:s| borealis| australis)?\b/, "What causes the northern lights", "The Sun constantly streams charged particles (the solar wind). Earth's magnetic field steers some of them toward the poles. There they hit oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere, about 100 to 300 km up. The atoms release that energy as light: green and red from oxygen, blue and purple from nitrogen. Strong solar storms make auroras brighter and visible farther from the poles."],
  [/\bleap years?\b.*\b(?:why|exist|have)\b|\bwhy (?:do we have|is there|are there) (?:a )?leap (?:years?|days?)\b/, "Why we have leap years", "Earth takes about 365.2422 days to go around the Sun, not exactly 365. Without a correction, the calendar would drift by about 1 day every 4 years against the seasons. So we add 29 February every 4 years. Century years are skipped unless divisible by 400 (2000 was a leap year, 1900 was not), which fine-tunes the average year to 365.2425 days."],
  [/\b(?:phases? of the moon|moon'?s? phases?|moon change shape|moon changes? shape)\b/, "Why the Moon has phases", "The Moon does not make its own light; the Sun always lights half of it. As the Moon orbits Earth every 29.5 days, we see different amounts of that lit half. The cycle runs new moon (lit side facing away), crescent, first quarter, gibbous, full moon (lit side facing us), then back again. Earth's shadow does not cause the phases; that only happens in a lunar eclipse."],
  [/\beclipses?\b.*\b(?:happen|caused|work)\b|\b(?:what causes|how do) (?:an? )?(?:solar |lunar )?eclipses?\b/, "How eclipses happen", "A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, casting its shadow on Earth. It can only happen at new moon. A lunar eclipse happens when Earth passes between the Sun and Moon, so Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, often turning it red. It can only happen at full moon. Eclipses do not happen every month because the Moon's orbit is tilted about 5 degrees."],
  [/\bstars?\b.*\btwinkle\b/, "Why stars twinkle", "Starlight passes through turbulent layers of air with different temperatures and densities, which bend it by constantly changing amounts. Stars are so far away that they are effectively points of light, so the bending makes them flicker in brightness and colour. Planets look like tiny discs and average the effect out, so they twinkle much less."],
  [/\bhow does the sun (?:produce|make|create|generate) (?:energy|light|heat)\b|\bhow does the sun (?:shine|work|burn)\b/, "How the Sun makes energy", "Nuclear fusion in its core. At about 15 million degrees C and enormous pressure, hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, and a little mass becomes energy (E = mc^2). The Sun converts about 4 million tonnes of mass into energy every second. That energy takes thousands of years or more to work its way out of the Sun, then 8 minutes 20 seconds to reach Earth as light."],
  [/\b(?:what causes|why do (?:we|you|people) get) hiccups\b|\bhiccups?\b.*\b(?:caused|happen)\b/, "What causes hiccups", "A hiccup is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm. It makes you suddenly breathe in, then your vocal cords snap shut with a 'hic'. Triggers include eating fast, a full stomach, fizzy drinks, alcohol and sudden excitement. Most bouts stop on their own within minutes. See a doctor if they last more than 48 hours."],
  [/\bonions?\b.*\b(?:cry|tears)\b/, "Why onions make you cry", "Cutting an onion breaks its cells and releases enzymes. They turn sulphur compounds into a gas called syn-propanethial-S-oxide. When it reaches your eyes it irritates them, and your tear glands flush it out. Chilling the onion or using a sharp knife reduces it."],
  [/\bhow do bees make honey\b|\bhow is honey made\b/, "How bees make honey", "Worker bees collect nectar from flowers and store it in a special honey stomach, where enzymes begin breaking its sugars down. Back at the hive they pass it between bees and deposit it into wax cells. They fan it with their wings until most of the water evaporates. Then they seal the cell with wax. A bee makes only about 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime."],
  [/\bwhy do (?:we|people|humans) sweat\b/, "Why we sweat", "Sweating cools you down. Glands release water with a little salt onto the skin. As it evaporates, it takes heat away from the body. You sweat more in heat, during exercise, with fever and when stressed. Sweat itself is almost odourless: body odour comes from skin bacteria breaking it down."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?microwaves? (?:oven )?work\b/, "How microwave ovens work", "A magnetron makes microwaves at about 2.45 GHz. The waves' electric field flips direction billions of times a second, and water molecules, which have a positive and a negative end, try to rotate with it. That jostling turns into heat, which cooks the food from the water inside. Metal reflects microwaves, which is why the oven's walls and door mesh keep them in."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) soap work\b|\bhow does soap (?:clean|kill)\b/, "How soap works", "A soap molecule has a water-loving head and an oil-loving tail. The tails bury themselves in grease and dirt, and the heads face out into the water. Together they form tiny balls (micelles) that trap the grease so water can rinse it away. Soap also breaks apart the fatty outer layer of many viruses and bacteria."],
  [/\bhow do fish breathe\b/, "How fish breathe", "Fish take water in through the mouth and push it over their gills, feathery organs full of tiny blood vessels. Oxygen dissolved in the water passes into the blood, and carbon dioxide passes out. Blood flows the opposite way to the water (countercurrent exchange), which lets gills extract up to about 80% of the oxygen."],
  [/\bgoosebumps\b/, "Why we get goosebumps", "Tiny muscles at the base of each hair contract, which pulls the hairs upright and dimples the skin. It is a reflex left over from furrier ancestors: raised fur traps warm air and makes an animal look bigger. It is triggered by cold, fear and strong emotions, such as moving music."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) the stock market work\b|\bwhat is the stock market\b/, "How the stock market works", "Companies sell shares (small pieces of ownership) to raise money. Investors then buy and sell those shares from each other on exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. Prices move with supply and demand: expectations about a company's future profits, the economy, interest rates and sentiment. Shareholders can gain from rising prices and dividends, and can also lose money."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a |an )?(?:car|combustion|petrol|gasoline) engines? work\b|\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?cars? (?:engine )?work\b/, "How a car engine works", "Most petrol engines use a four-stroke cycle in each cylinder. Intake: a piston moves down, drawing in air and fuel. Compression: the piston moves up and squeezes the mixture. Power: a spark plug ignites it, and the expanding gas forces the piston down. Exhaust: the piston pushes the burnt gas out. The pistons turn a crankshaft, which drives the wheels through the transmission."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:the )?(?:human )?brain work\b/, "How the brain works", "The brain has about 86 billion neurons. Each connects to thousands of others through synapses, making roughly 100 trillion connections. Neurons communicate with electrical impulses and chemical messengers (neurotransmitters). Different regions specialise, for example vision in the occipital lobe and planning in the frontal lobe, but most tasks involve networks of regions working together. Connections strengthen or weaken with use, which is how we learn."],
  [/\bwhat is gravity\b|\bhow (?:does|do) gravity work\b|\bwhy do things fall\b/, "Gravity", "Gravity is the attraction between things with mass or energy. Newton described it as a force that grows with mass and weakens with the square of distance (F = G m1 m2 / r^2). Einstein's general relativity explains it more precisely: mass and energy curve spacetime, and objects follow that curvature. On Earth it accelerates falling objects at about 9.81 m/s^2."],
  [/^what is the cloud$|\bcloud computing\b/, "The cloud", "\"The cloud\" means computing services (storage, servers, databases, software) run in someone else's large data centres and used over the internet, instead of on your own machines. Examples include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Google Drive and iCloud. You rent what you use and can scale it up or down quickly."],
  [/\bhow (?:does|do) (?:a )?(?:solar panels?|solar power) work\b/, "How solar panels work", "Solar cells are made of silicon layers treated to create an electric field between them. When light hits the cell, photons knock electrons loose (the photovoltaic effect). The field pushes those electrons one way, which produces a direct current. An inverter converts it to the alternating current used in homes. Typical panels turn about 18 to 23% of sunlight into electricity."],
